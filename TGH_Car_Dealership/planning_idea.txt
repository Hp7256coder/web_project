I'm planning to make an order tab for the user_info_page.php that just appear when user
click "your order" button in this user_info_page

When user click this button, the block that has user information table, user address table,
and user payment method table will disappear. After that, a block that has user order information
will appear.

I can use reactjs and make the order information from an external javascript file and input into 
this site, or I can use an external php file to make order information for user and then input into
this site using jQuery ajax.

Notice that use react in this situation is not quite effective since react don't support write PHP 
syntax. I have to create a PHP file and then add react inside it if I want to practice to write 
Reactjs syntax in this page.
