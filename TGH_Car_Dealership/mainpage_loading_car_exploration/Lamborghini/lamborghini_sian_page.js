    _overview:`
    The first open-top hybrid Lamborghini super sports car to feature a supercapacitor,
     the Sián Roadster roars with electrified intensity,
      resonating with the inimitable V12 sound from the most powerful Lamborghini engine to date.
       Limited to only 19 examples, the Sián Roadster advances hybrid technology with the world’s
        first use of a supercapacitor in a materials-science application unique to the industry.

    _exterior:`
    EXTERIOR
The futuristic Lamborghini design features long, sculptured contours 
and distinctive aero wings to define a commanding and powerful profile, 
a shape that is pure and purposeful. The very low front, 
enhanced by an integrated carbon fiber splitter and the iconic Lamborghini Y-shaped headlights,
 optimizes aerodynamic efficiency, for a sensation perceptible from within the open-air cabin.
    
    `,
    _interior:`
    Lamborghini elevates the design of its hybrid cars with sophisticated
     aluminum details painted in Oro Electrum (gold), the color Lamborghini has chosen to identify
      it’s hybrid cars. The purposeful interior of the Sián Roadster embraces this elegant
       effect with Y-shaped features and distinctive hexagonal accents harkening back to the first
        Lamborghini Miura. Every touch reflects meticulous attention to detail,
         from the driver controls to the newly designed air vents produced by special 3D printing,
          a technology that allows a customer’s initials to be incorporated into the vent design.
    `,
    _specifications_and_performance:`
    
    Based on the Lamborghini Aventador, the Sián FKP 37 shares 
    its engine with the SVJ variant of the Aventador, but an electric motor integrated
     into the gearbox adds another 25 kW to the power output. Other modifications to the engine
      include the addition of titanium intake valves, a reconfigured ECU and a new exhaust system
       raising the power output to 785 PS. The total power output is 819 PS, making the Sián the most
        powerful production Lamborghini. The engine is connected to a 7-speed automated manual
         transmission[5] and the car employs an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system
          with a rear mechanical self-locking differential for improved handling.[6]

The power for the electric motor is stored in a supercapacitor unit instead of conventional
 lithium-ion batteries. The supercapacitor unit is integrated with the electric motor into the 
 gearbox in order for a better weight distribution. Supercapacitors were chosen due to their ability 
 to provide three times the power of a conventional lithium-ion battery of the same weight. 
 The unit installed in the car is an evolution of the Aventador's starter motor and can store ten 
 times more power than the unit it is based on. A regenerative braking system helps generate enough
  energy to recharge the supercapacitors. The electric motor counters the effect of deceleration
   and provides a power boost to the driver at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph). The motor supports
    low-speed manoeuvres such as parking and reversing.[7][8]

The improvements made to the car help accelerate it from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.8 seconds 
and attain an electronically limited top speed of 350 km/h (220 mph) but the official top speed 
is to be confirmed.

    _design:`
    
    The exterior design incorporates a wedge shape, a trademark of famed automobile designer
     Marcello Gandini and mixes that with the design of the Terzo Millennio concept introduced
      two years prior. The Y shaped daytime running headlights are inspired by the Terzo Millennio
       while at the rear an active fixed rear wing with the number "63" embossed on its winglets 
       to honour the company's year of incorporation creates downforce. Downforce is maximised by
        the model's prominent side air intakes and large carbon-fibre front splitter. A transparent
         "Peroscopio" glass panel runs from the centre of the roof and rolls back into the slatted
          engine cover adds light and visibility for the occupants, and the six hexagonal taillights
           are an inspiration from the Countach.

Along with the wing, active cooling vanes at the rear are used which are activated by a smart
 material that reacts to heat. When a certain temperature is reached, the vanes rotate for extra
  airflow.

The interior is based heavily on the Aventador's interior, but the centre console has been tidied
 up and a portrait touchscreen first seen in the Huracán Evo is one of the key differences. 
 The leather upholstery has been done by Poltrona Frau, an Italian furniture company and 3D printed 
 parts are used on the interior for the first time.[4]
