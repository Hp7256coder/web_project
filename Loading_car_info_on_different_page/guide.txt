In this project, we got 3 file test1.php, test2.php, and car_list.json
 we get car data from  a json file and display it on test1.php using .directive() method of angularJS
This directive method will help test2.php automatically create more and more element by itself and display it on test1.php as long as car_list.json expand more data.

Notice that we can see content of test2.php on a web browser loading test1.php page, we can not see these content on a web browser loading test2.php because all the new data element syntax just appear in web browser that load test1.php file when we inspect this page, not in test2.php file.
