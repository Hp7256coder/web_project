+In this project I used ReactJS, AngularJS, javaScript, jQuery, Html, Css, PHP to get car data to add to a car shopping list

+User when enter this test1.php just see a form that have 2 input field and a +add button

+ Below input field is a text called "Your Car info is:"

+If user fill out the the first input field the car model name that match  lamborghini aventador,  lamborghini huracan, or  lamborghini veneno, 
then the test1.php page will take data from test2.php and display the correct block that has image and title of the exact same car

+If user click +add button, new car model name will be added into this form list


+User can not add the same car model into this form list

+User can remove a car that have been added into this list by click the x button that placed on the right of a block contain a new car added into this list

+I used some syntax to convert each first letter to uppercase letter that user input into the input field if they separate each word with a whitespace

+I placed syntax of two input field into ReactJS syntax block

+Notice that because some element being made by ReactJS doesn't appear in the test1.php when working with VS Code. I have to use JQuery for selector, not javaScript

+Notice that I meet some error like below, yet this program still working properly
