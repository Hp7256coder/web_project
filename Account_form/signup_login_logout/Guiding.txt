using PHP,MySQL,Javascript,html,css , and at least 3 document to make a website that  

Lead users to three different page 

One page has login ,sign up button with login, and sign up form 

a page for thank you user because they have registered information, an another page 

That show the information of user and main content  

 

They are two different forms, user needs to register information before accessing to the third page 

After they registered information, they will see a page that thanks them 

Now when they click the button to return to the first page, this page always lead users to page 3 

 

On page 3 we have a button call log-out and a button has the name of user  

If user click log-out, all local storage information will be removed and returned to the first page 

If user click the button has their name, a form will appear show them their information that they have registered 

 

 

This project should use with mySQL to store information because when the local storage information has remove, then the user can not log-in anymore. They have to register again instead. 

On the other hand, if local storage is exists, then the user can not come back to the first page
